A NATO representative told The Times that the new 
information about China's military support for Russia is "deeply concerning,"  
which could signify a major escalation in Beijing's 
involvement in the war in Ukraine.

A source from The Times claims that 
the West has evidence of an unnamed 
Chinese company's involvement in 
supplying Russia with "a range of 
purpose-built military drones" used in Ukraine.
