Western officials believe they have obtained 
evidence of secret arms supplies from China to Russia, 
which could signify a major escalation in Beijing's 
involvement in the war in Ukraine.

A source from The Times claims that 
the West has evidence of an unnamed 
Chinese company's involvement in 
supplying Russia with "a range of 
purpose-built military drones" used in Ukraine.
